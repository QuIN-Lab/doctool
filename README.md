# Documentation Generation Tool

This tool aims to make it easy to generate documentation as a function of source code.
Making it as easy as possible to keep documentation up to date gives the best
chances that that actually happens.

## Usage

See [usage.md](docs/usage.md)


## TODO

- Make this work with LuaLaTeX.
- Make a repository for lua version list and link to it from here.
